        <p>Recent advances in the field of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have facilitated the establishment of very successful object recognition models in Artificial Intelligence. Deep Neural Networks, and more specifically, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are inspired by the primate brain’s visual system and they apparently rival the representational performance of the Inferior Temporal (IT) Cortex on visual object recognition tasks [1], while outperforming every other computer vision model on similar tasks [2].<br>
   The IT Cortex is crucial for visual object recognition and is considered to be the final stage in the ventral cortical visual system [3]. Functional imaging (fMRI) and single cell studies in monkeys and humans reveal that the IT cortex contains representations of bodies. Face- and body-selective regions were identified in human visual cortex using fMRI [4,5]. Monkey-fMRI studies [6-10] show body-selective patches in macaque IT. Previous and ongoing single unit studies in our laboratory studied the stimulus selectivity of neurons in body category selective patches that are activated more strongly by images of bodies compared to other objects, including faces [11].<br>
   Similarly to the primate brain’s visual hierarchy, CNNs’ information processing relies on the increasing complexity of the neural representations along the visual pathways, which is expressed in the layers of the networks (Figure 1). Thus, lower layers contain local visual feature detectors that have small receptive fields (RFs) and higher layers, units have global RFs that receive inputs from all units of the previous layer. The convolutional architecture with the in-between local pooling stages, allows for object translation, rotation and scale invariance; all of which, are important attributes of the primate brain and non-trivial problems for earlier computer vision models [12], that are now robustly outperformed by CNNs. Therefore, CNN models are seemingly promising candidates for modeling primate vision.<br>
   Already, there are devised methods applied to CNNs’ components for visualizing the RFs and selectivities of their units[13-17]. These results principally show how the response is driven through the network according to a particular stimuli. Furthermore, various studies have already assessed CNNs as biological vision models and they find that models which exploit representational spaces that are alike those of the IT cortex [18], usually perform better at object recognition [19,20].</p>
